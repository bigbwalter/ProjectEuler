# ProjectEuler
Project Euler is a website that contains several hundred programming and math puzzles.
These take the form of math problems that are too complicated to solve by hand, so the user has to program a computer to solve the problems.
In this project you will find my solutions to several of these problems, and in some cases the solutions will be published in multiple programming languages.
Enjoy!
